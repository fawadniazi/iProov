## Requirements
Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- macOS (latest version recommended)
- Xcode (latest stable version)
- Swift (latest stable version included with Xcode)
- CocoaPods (if dependencies are managed using it) - Install via:
  ```sh
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```
- Homebrew (optional for additional dependencies) - Install via:
  ```sh
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fawadniazi/iProov.git
cd iProov
```

If the project uses CocoaPods, install dependencies:
```sh

```
Then, open the `.xcworkspace` file instead of `.xcodeproj`:
```sh
open iProov.xcworkspace
```

## Build and Run

1. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```sh
   open iProov.xcworkspace  # If using CocoaPods
   open iProov.xcodeproj     # If not using CocoaPods
   ```
2. In the  `Credentials.swift` Update the Base URL, API Key and Secret
3. Select a simulator or a connected iOS device from the Xcode toolbar. **This will only work on a real device**; it will not work in the simulator.
4. Build and run the app using:
   - Click the **Run** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) in Xcode.
   - Or use the shortcut: `Cmd + R`.
